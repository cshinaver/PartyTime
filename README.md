PartyTime App practice

## NOTES
* Always create new features using git branches. Never commit new stuff
    directly to the master branch
* When a feature is done, create a pull request on github so the changes can be
    reviewed and commented on by others

## TODOs
- [ ]  Create basic interface sketchup
- [ ]  Add friend's list functionality 
- [ ]  Create webserver with login capability from app
