PartyTime App practice

## NOTES
* Always create new features using git branches. Never commit new stuff
    directly to the master branch
* When a feature is done, create a pull request on github so the changes can be
    reviewed and commented on by others
* If you use a tutorial to implement a feature, make sure to add a comment
    above the code that you wrote with a link to the tutorial. This will help
    explain to other what you did and why
